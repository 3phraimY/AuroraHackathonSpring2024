# CUW Hackathon Spring 2024 sponsored by Aurora WDC! 

## Hackathon Format

Date: Tuesday, April 16th, 2024

Time: 04:30 PM CST - 09:30 PM CST

## Challenge Overview

In this 5 hour Hackathon you will dive deep into Discord servers and channels, extracting insights from posts and conducting sentiment analysis. In addition to data extraction, we'd like to able to categorize _Users_ on the Discord Channel under the three categories below: 

1. Creator (ex: Author of the Youtube Video)
2. Curator (ex: Discord User who posted the Video)
3. Consumer (ex: Users who have interacted with the post on Discord; Viewed, Reacted or Commented)

More info _may_ be provided on the day of the Hackathon

## Requirements

In this challenge, you will explore the [Discord API](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) and [Youtube Unofficial API](https://github.com/jdepoix/youtube-transcript-api/tree/master) in order to extract and analyze the posts in the _General_ Channel on the _OpenRECON_ Discord server. Server and Channel IDs will be provided on the day of the Hackathon.


## Bonus:
Add a Graph database like [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/docs/python-manual/current/) to your code in order to organize data as nodes, relationships, and properties. Nodes represent entities, relationships represent connections between entities, and properties represent attributes of nodes and relationships. This can enhance your data analysis output and potentially generate deeper insights.


### Steps for this Hackathon

* Teams should fork this Repo and use it for submission
* We Expect to you to work _together_ instead of competing. This will create a _pair programming_ environment
